# Crowdfunding_ETL

This project consisted us of building a ETL pipeline, by utilizing Python and Pandas.
With the given contacts.xlsx file we were tasked with four sub-projects

- Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
- Create the Campaign DataFrame
- Create the Contacts DataFrame

The Crowdfunding Database was then created by using PostgresSql.
